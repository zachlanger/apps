Trees Riddle

12
|A|
---
|B|
 8

Less than or equal to 18? or greater than or equal to 20?

Day 1
	A passes because he sees 12. But if he could see >18, he would know there couldn't be <=18 trees, so
	B knows that A has <=18

	B passes because he sees 8 and knows A has X<=18. But if he could see <=1, he would know there couldn't be >=20, so
	A knows that B has >=2 trees

Day 2
	A passes because he sees 12 and knows B has >=2. But if he could see >16, he would know there couldn't be <=18 trees, so
	B knows that A has <=16

	B passes because he sees 8 and A has X<=16. But if he could see <=3, he would know there couldn't be >=20, so
	A knows that B has >=4 trees

Day 3
	A passes because he sees 12 and knows B has >=4. But if he could see >14, he would know there couldn't be <=18 trees, so
	B knows that A has <=14

	B passes because he sees 8 and A has X<=14. But if he could see <=5, he would know there couldn't be >=20, so
	A knows that B has >=6 trees

Day 4
	A passes because he sees 12 and knows B has >=6. But if he could see >12, he would know there couldn't be <=18 trees, so
	B knows that A has <=12

	B passes because he sees 8 and A has X<=12. But if he could see <=7, he would know there couldn't be >=20, so
	A knows that B has >=8 trees

Day 5
	A knows that B has >=8 and A sees 12, so I knows that there are 20 or more trees, and theyre set free
